### Installation

Please follow the steps given below. First two steps are optional.

- Create a virtual environment by `virtualenv TO/YOUR/DIR`
- Activate your virtual environment:

    - on Windows: run `Scripts/activate`
    - on Linux and Mac: it should be something like Windows, can't remember
    
- Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If everything worked so far you should be able to run the server by calling `python.exe .\manage.py runserver`
